❯ /lyra:lyra I need a complete redisign of the dashboard, but lets start simple.
 I want to do one piece at a time. I want to use daisyUI and eleminate all of   
the Flux components from the application entirely. The main dashboard needs to  
have a high view of the data, starting with region by region.  There should be  
total active circuits, total miles, total miles planned, remaining miles to be  
planned and total unit count. Lets start with lehigh region and work on         
displaying the info from the data about circuits.  I want to start completely   
from scratch, and make a clean file structure and make components reusable as   
much as possible.  Everything should be run by me first before creating.  The   
layout will also need discussed but can be fine toned later. for now the main   
layout will consist of a sidebar and a top header bar. also at a later time i   
will be implementing similar dashboard but work work jobs. so it will be        
important that it is distigushed that this is data from the assessments side, so
 folder structure and nameing should talke this into consideration. As well as  
making componets reusabel for when the work jobs dashboard is implemented.  We  
will start with creating the sudo admin dashboard that will have all the        
funtionality and features and we can use permissions to control what users can  
see and do. Also we want a mobile first design but mobile will not display or   
contain nearly as much as a tablet or desktop will.  mobile design will only be 
for a quick view of high level data and will eventually be able to be customized
 by the user in thier settings but this will be later, also on mobile the user  
if they have permissions to do so may be allowed to assign a circuit to a       
planner, and move the circuit to a diffrent stage of the workflow but everything
 else will be limited to tablet screen and above.  Tablet views will have to    
have most of the funtionality added in a way as to not cludder the screen so    
buttons or using the side bar for this will need to be considered. The most     
important things are that one piece is created at a time, tooltips are added to 
all necessary UI elements, components are extracted into reusable elements, the 
folder structure is kept clean and organized, flux is not to be used at all and 
use of Daisy UI is only permitted, live data is used when creating the elements,
 filtering of all elements must cover the entire page with everything living    
inside one parent element that controls the state, performance and caching of UI
 must be implemented and optimized, users must be allowed to customize the      
dashboard by removing or adding predefined elements, such as charts, tables,    
data cards etc., allow as many elements that would increase the UX and UI to be 
drag and drop, we must git branch when starting a new piece of the UI, then     
merege and commit the branch once testing has passed.    As of right now I want 
the following pages/dashboard, User on Boarding / Welcome (first sign in, select
 theme, main dashboard view, add WS credentials),Overview Dashbaord (Main Data  
points of evry region),  Kanban board for circuits (one region at a time),      
Analytics for circuits (one region at a time), Planner Dashboard (unsure of     
desired designs), Sync Controls (admins only), Data Management (sudo only, edit 
end points, view raw data, exclude data, overwrite data, etc.)  User Management 
(Sudo admin only), user setting (all users), more pages will probably be needed 
and we must consider how we are to allow users to make a custom dashboard. Also 
prefrences such as prefered region, if they have moved, removed, added an       
element will need to be stored to local storage as well as saved to database if 
the user is flagged as having custom settings when they login.  Lets start with 
creating just a boiler plate layout that has a sidebar and a top header, we can 
just use some mock links and elements in these elements until we get some paged 
built and can wire it up after that. once we get a layout lets start with the   
overview dashboard and concentrate on just circuit data, then we can look at    
planned unit data and planner data, remember the Overview page is for a high    
view of the data by region.

  # WS-Tracker Dashboard Redesign - Assessments Module                          
                                                                                
  ## PROJECT CONTEXT                                                            
  You are redesigning the WS-Tracker dashboard from scratch, replacing all Flux 
  components with DaisyUI 5. This dashboard displays assessment data (circuits, 
  planned units, planners) organized by region. A future "Work Jobs" dashboard  
  will share components, so architecture must support both.                     
                                                                                
  ## TECH STACK & CONSTRAINTS                                                   
  - **UI Framework:** DaisyUI 5 + Tailwind CSS 4 (NO Flux components)           
  - **Backend:** Laravel 12 + Livewire 3                                        
  - **State Management:** Alpine.js-primary for UI state, Livewire for server   
  state/data                                                                    
  - **Colors:** DaisyUI semantic colors ONLY (primary, base-*, success, error,  
  etc.)                                                                         
  - **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first with progressive enhancement

  - **Mobile (<768px):** Drawer overlay sidebar, high-level stats only, limited 
  actions (assign planner, move circuit stage)                                  
  - **Tablet (768-1024px):** Full functionality via sidebar actions or          
  contextual buttons                                                            
  - **Desktop (>1024px):** Full dashboard with all features visible             
                                                                                
  ## STATE MANAGEMENT PATTERN                                                   
  All dashboard pages wrap content in a single parent Alpine component that     
  manages:

  ### **Key Improvements Made:**                                                
                                                                                
  | Original Issue | Optimization Applied |                                     
  |----------------|---------------------|                                      
  | Requirements scattered across wall of text | Structured into scannable      
  sections with clear hierarchy |                                               
  | Implicit folder structure expectations | Explicit folder convention with    
  future-proofing for Work Jobs |                                               
  | Vague "mobile-first" directive | Concrete breakpoint behaviors defined |    
  | Unclear approval workflow | Step-by-step workflow with file-based gates |   
  | Missing state management pattern | Alpine-primary pattern with code example 
  |                                                                             
  | Persistence strategy unclear | Specific sync logic with conflict resolution 
  |

  ### **Techniques Applied:**                                                   
  - **Role Assignment:** Positioned as a redesign task with clear tech          
  constraints                                                                   
  - **Constraint Optimization:** Hard rules (no Flux, DaisyUI only) stated      
  upfront                                                                       
  - **Task Decomposition:** Numbered implementation order with checkboxes       
  - **Context Layering:** Folder structure, state patterns, and mobile behavior 
  all defined                                                                   
                                                                                
  ---                                                                           
                                                                                
  ### **Pro Tip:**                                                              
  Copy this master prompt into your project's `CLAUDE.md` or a dedicated        
  `docs/dashboard-redesign-spec.md`. Each time you start a new phase, reference 
  it with:                                                                      
                                                                                
  > "Continue with Phase X from the dashboard redesign spec. Write the plan file
   first."                                                                      
                                                                                
  This keeps context consistent across sessions without re-explaining           
  everything.

  Why parallel layouts? Creating a new layout alongside the existing Flux one   
  allows incremental migration. Auth pages, settings, and admin can continue    
  using Flux while we build and test the new dashboard. This prevents a "big    
  bang" rewrite that could introduce bugs across the entire app.                
                                                                                
  Alpine store pattern: Using Alpine.store('dashboard', {...}) creates a single 
  source of truth for UI state that any component can access. This is cleaner   
  than prop-drilling and allows the sidebar, header, and content area to stay in
   sync without tight coupling.

  Theme system refactor rationale: Rather than patching the broken theme system,
   a clean rebuild ensures:                                                     
  1. Single source of truth for theme state (Alpine store)                      
  2. Proper separation of concerns (FOUC prevention separate from Alpine)       
  3. Clean sync pattern (localStorage → immediate, DB → debounced background)   
                                                                                
  This prevents the "two systems fighting each other" problem that often causes 
  theme flickering issues.

❯ Approved, but instead of implementation lets go ahead and discuss and         
  plan the next 2 steps then we can start implementation. so lets discuss       
  what the next steps should be then discuss the elements(s) that will be       
  created, what will be modified and what we can remove.

  ⎿  · For Phase 2 (Overview Dashboard), how should the regional data be        
     displayed? → Both options                                                  
     · Should the Overview Dashboard show data for ALL regions at once, or      
     default to user's preferred region? → 3 but the user will select this      
     during the on boarding page when they sign in for the first time.

● User answered Claude's questions:                                             
  ⎿  · Should clicking a region card navigate to that region's Analytics        
     page, or open a detail panel/modal? → Both with default                    
     · For the Analytics page, should charts be user-rearrangeable              
     (drag-and-drop)? → Fixed now, drag later                                   
     · Should we build User Onboarding as Phase 2.5 (before Overview goes       
     live) or defer it? → Build as Phase 2.5

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────                               
  Why onboarding before Overview goes live? The Overview Dashboard reads        
  dashboard_preferences to determine:                                           
  - Show cards or table by default                                              
  - Filter to user's region or show all                                         
                                                                                
  Without onboarding, these preferences would be null, requiring fallback logic.
   By building onboarding first, every user has explicit preferences set, making
   the Overview code cleaner and the UX consistent.                             
                                                                                
  Slide-out panel pattern: This is a common dashboard UX pattern that keeps     
  users in context while showing details. It's faster than full navigation and  
  works well on tablet/desktop. On mobile, the panel becomes full-screen.

  Let me know if you'd like any changes, or reply "Approved" for both and I'll

❯ I like it, couple things lets make the daisy UI corportate theme the          
  default and also give more options for theme, really Id like to add all       
  the availible themes so consider extracting the theme values to the           
  config file so they can be updated in one place. this would be for the        
  onboarding of course. Also I would like to create the data management         
  dashboard for the sudo admin after 2.5 so there is a way to control the       
  data before making the kanban etc.  Also, we need to keep adding              
  permissions later in mind. so can we plan the data management page next       
  then I will start to build them out                                           
                                                                                
● Good points. Let me update the theme approach and create the Data Management  
  plan.

  Why Data Management before Kanban?                                            
                                                                                
  1. Data integrity first: If bad data exists (duplicates, test circuits,       
  errors), the Kanban would display it. Better to have tools to clean data      
  first.                                                                        
  2. Foundation for exclusions: The Kanban needs to respect is_excluded flags.  
  Building the exclusion system first ensures the Kanban inherits correct       
  behavior.                                                                     
  3. Audit trail infrastructure: The activity_log and user_modified_fields      
  patterns built here will be reused when users drag circuits between Kanban    
  stages.                                                                       
                                                                                
  Permission infrastructure: Even though we're only using sudo_admin now, the   
  code structure (@can checks, policy stubs) makes adding granular permissions  
  later a configuration change rather than a refactor.

❯ lets go ahead and make a quick rough draft for context later on the           
  remaining pages so they follow the same stucture and design ideas as what     
  was planned already. so create a context file for the syncing dashboard,      
  kanban and anylytics dashboard and user management, just something you        
  can use to continue planning correctly after i clear your context.            
                                                                                
● I'll create a combined context file that captures the design patterns and     
  rough specs for the remaining pages.

  2. Layout sketches - Visual reference for consistency                         
  3. Database awareness - Which tables feed which features                      
  4. Mobile priorities - What to build vs defer for small screens

  DaisyUI Drawer Pattern: The drawer uses a checkbox toggle (drawer-toggle) for 
  state management. This is pure CSS-driven, but we'll enhance it with Alpine.js
   for:                                                                         
  1. Programmatic control (close on navigation)                                 
  2. State persistence (remember collapsed state)                               
  3. Keyboard accessibility (Escape to close)                                   
                                                                                
  Responsive Strategy: lg:drawer-open keeps sidebar visible on desktop, while   
  mobile users toggle via hamburger. We'll add a collapse toggle for desktop    
  users who want icon-only mode.

  /export ../design-context-2
